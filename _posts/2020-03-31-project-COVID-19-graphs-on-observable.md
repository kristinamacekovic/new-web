# Description

I've wanted to check out [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) for a while, but it looked pretty intimidating whenever I started.  Enter COVID-19 and this [straightforward tutorial](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/tutorial?collection=@observablehq/tutorial) and suddenly I had an interesting topic and some tools under my belt to actually do it. I used Vega-lite for visualisations, JS and d3.js for some data wrangling, and html and markdown syntax for titles and explanations. Data is pulled via the awesome [COVID-19 API](https://covid19api.com). The whole process was really fun and I was amazed by fast you can produce something without a lot of hassle. Check out the notebooks there for some serious inspiration üòç

# Nice Resources I Found Along the Way
[Data manipulation, cleaning, and processing in JavaScript](http://learnjsdata.com):
Website with tutorials on data wrangling with JS (mostly d3.js). I found it while I was researching how to aggregate data by an object property.
